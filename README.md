# Godot Space Shooter Game

In order to experiment with different game engines and have fun learning the differences, I created a simple asteroids-style spaceship shooter game in Unity and Godot.

The Unity version was the original, but I was drawn to the FOSS counterpart bc I'm a nerdy linux firefox user.

Unlike Unity, there are no native 2D primitives, so sprites came from [Kenny's](https://kenney.nl/assets) free 2D sprite library. Thanks Kenny!
